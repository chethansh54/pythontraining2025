# Structure of python program
# Conditional flow
# Looping

# Program Structure

# import section : if you want to import any third party or any other library
# variable list section : where you declare or create any variable
# function declarations or definition section : where you write your function definition
# statements : section where actual calculations or decisions or looping happens
# best part : these things can be written or used anywhere in the code


'''
conditional flow :

If you want your program to run based on decisions, then we need conditional flow.

1. if condition
2. if else condition
3. if elif else condition
4. nested conditions
'''

'''
looping flow :

If you want your program to run multiple times upto certain condition or limit,
then you need looping.

1. while loop
2. for loop
